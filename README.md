# Berlin_Flats
Immobilien Scout 24 Dataset, contains entries from rental flats in Berlin. 
In this dataset, we can find information about rentals' price, space, condition, region, and the number of rooms. 
We can categorize them by these parameters and find a lot of information like the most expensive region in Berlin, or regions with the best price/square meter, or even we can find a good place with their budget and needs. 
I had some ideas and questions and tried to find a suitable answer for them.
